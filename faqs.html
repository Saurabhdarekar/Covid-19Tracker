<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms and when should I seek medical care?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to seek medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on self-isolation.</p><p>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.&nbsp; Seek medical help.&nbsp; When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distance from other
    people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice.</p><p>Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. If possible, call your health care provider in advance, so he/she can direct you to the right health facility.</p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How does COVID-19 spread?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p></p><p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19 coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink to the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with the virus. &nbsp;This is why it is important to stay at least 1 meter) away from others. These droplets can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails.&nbsp; People can become infected<s> </s>by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. &nbsp;This is why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based hand rub.<br /></p> <p>WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Can COVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>COVID-19 is mainly spread through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing or has other symptoms such as fever or tiredness. Many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true in the early stages of the
    disease. It is possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has just a mild cough and does not feel ill.
</p><p>Some reports have indicated that people with no symptoms can transmit the virus. It is not yet known how often it happens. WHO is assessing ongoing research on the topic and will continue to share updated findings.</p></div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How can we protect others and ourselves if we don&#39;t know who is infected?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p></p><p>Practicing hand and respiratory hygiene is important at ALL times and is the best way to protect others and yourself<s>.</s></p><p>When possible maintain at least a 1 meter distance between yourself and others. This is especially important if you are standing by someone who is coughing or sneezing.&nbsp; Since some infected persons may not yet be exhibiting symptoms or their symptoms may be mild, maintaining a physical distance with everyone is a good idea if you are in an area where COVID-19 is circulating.&nbsp;</p><p></p> 
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What should I do if I have come in close contact with someone who has COVID-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>If you have been in close contact with someone with COVID-19, you may be infected.</p><p>Close contact means that you live with or have been in settings of less than 1 metre from those who have the disease. In these cases, it is best to stay at home. 
  </p><p>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice. </p><p>If you do <strong>not</strong> live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:
  </p><ul><li>If you become ill, even with very mild symptoms you must self-isolate 
  </li><li>Even if you don&rsquo;t think you have been exposed to COVID-19 but develop symptoms, then self-isolate and monitor yourself 
  </li><li>You are more likely to infect others in the early stages of the disease when you just have mild symptoms, therefore early self-isolation is very important.
  </li><li>If you do not have symptoms, but have been exposed to an infected person, self-quarantine for 14 days.
  </li></ul><p>If you have definitely had COVID-19 (confirmed by a test)  self-isolate for 14 days even after symptoms have disappeared as a precautionary measure &ndash; it is not yet known exactly how long people remain infectious after they have recovered. Follow national advice on self-isolation.
  </p>  
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What does it mean to self-isolate?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Self-isolation is an important measure taken by those who have COVID-19 symptoms to avoid infecting others in the community, including family members. </p><p>Self-isolation is when a person who is experiencing fever, cough or other COVID-19 symptoms stays at home and does not go to work, school or public places.  This can be voluntarily or based on his/her health care provider&rsquo;s recommendation. However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.  Seek medical help.  When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a child who is sick help the child stick to this advice. </p><p>If you do not live in an area with malaria or dengue fever please do the following:
  </p><p style="margin-left:30px;">-&nbsp; If a person is in self-isolation, it is because he/she is ill but not severely ill (requiring medical attention)
  </p><ul style="margin-left:30px;"><li>have a large, well-ventilated with hand-hygiene and toilet facilities </li><li>If this is not possible, place beds at least 1 metre apart
  </li><li>Keep at least 1 metre from others, even from your family members
  </li><li>Monitor your symptoms daily
  </li><li>Isolate for 14 days, even if you feel healthy
  </li><li>If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately &ndash; call them first if possible</li><li>Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.

<button type="button" class="collapsible">What should I do if I have no symptoms, but I think I have been exposed to COVID-19? What does it mean to self-quarantine?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>To self-quarantine means to separate yourself from others because you have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 even though you, yourself, do not have symptoms.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"></span>During self-quarantine you monitor yourself
    for symptoms.&nbsp; The goal of the self-quarantine is to prevent transmission.&nbsp; Since people who become ill with COVID-19 can infect people immediately self-quarantine can prevent some infections from happening.&nbsp; .</p><p>In this case:</p><ul><li>Have a large, well-ventilated single room with hand hygiene and toilet facilities</li><li>If this is not available place beds at least 1 metre apart.</li><li>Keep at least 1-metre distance from others, even from your family members.</li><li>Monitor your symptoms daily</li><li>Self-quarantine for 14 days, even if you feel healthy</li><li>If you develop difficulty breathing, contact your healthcare provider immediately &ndash; call them first if possible.</li><li>Stay positive and energized by keeping in touch with loved ones by phone or online, and by exercising yourself at home.</li></ul><p>However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore symptoms of fever.&nbsp; Seek medical help.&nbsp; When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible, keep at least 1 metre distant from

</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"> What is the difference between self-isolation, self-quarantine and distancing?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p></p><p>Quarantine means restricting activities or separating <span style="text-decoration:underline;">people who are not ill</span> themselves but may have been exposed to COVID-19. The goal is to prevent spread of the disease at the time when people just develop symptoms..</p><p>Isolation means separating <span style="text-decoration:underline;">people who are ill</span> with symptoms of COVID-19 and may be infectious to prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>Physical distancing means being physically apart. WHO recommends keeping at least 1<s>-</s>metre distance from others. This is a general measure that <span style="text-decoration:underline;">everyone</span> should take even if they are well with no known exposure to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p></p>  
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Can children or adolescents catch COVID-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Research indicates that children and adolescents are just as likely to become infected as any other age group and can spread the disease.</p><p>Evidence to date suggests that children and young adults are less likely to get severe disease, but severe cases can still happen in these age groups. 
  </p><p>Children and adults should follow the same guidance on self-quarantine and self-isolation if there is a risk they have been exposed or are showing symptoms. It is particularly important that children avoid contact with older people and others who are at risk of more severe disease.
  </p> 
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How long does it take after exposure to COVID-19 to develop symptoms?</button>
<div class="content">
  The time between exposure to COVID-19 and the moment when symptoms start is commonly around five to six days but can range from 1 &ndash; 14 days.
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">What is the connection between COVID-19 and animals?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>COVID-19 is spread through human-to-human transmission. 
  </p><p>We already know a lot about other viruses in the coronavirus family and most of these types of viruses have an origin in animals. The COVID-19 virus (also called SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus in humans. The possible animal source of COVID-19 has not yet been confirmed but research is ongoing.
  </p><p>WHO continues to monitor the latest research on this and other COVID-19 topics and will update, as new findings are available.
  </p>  
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">  How long does the virus survive on surfaces?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p class="sf-accordion__summary">
    <p>The most important thing to know about coronavirus on surfaces is that they can easily be cleaned with common household disinfectants that will kill the virus. Studies have shown that the COVID-19 virus can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel, less than 4 hours on copper and less than 24 hours on cardboard.
</p><p>As, always clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose.
</p> 
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How to grocery shop safely?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>When grocery shopping, keep at least 1-metre distance from others and avoid touching your eyes, mouth and nose. If possible, sanitize the handles of shopping trolleys or baskets before shopping. Once home, wash your hands thoroughly and also after handling and storing your purchased products.
  </p><p>There is currently no confirmed case of COVID-19 transmitted through food or food packaging.
  </p> 
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">How to wash fruits and vegetables?</button>
<div class="content">
  Fruits and vegetables are important components of a healthy diet. Wash them the same way you should do under any circumstance: before handling them, wash your hands with soap and water. Then, wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly with clean water, especially if you eat them raw.  
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating COVID-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses; they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. In hospitals physicians will sometimes use antibiotics to prevent or treat secondary bacterial infections which can be a complication of COVID-19 in severely ill patients. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection.  </p>  
</div>
<button type="button" class="collapsible">Can I catch COVID-19 from the faeces of someone with the disease?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in faeces in some cases, to date, there have not been reports of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Additionally, there is no evidence to date on the survival of the COVID-19 virus in water or sewage.
  </p><p>WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings on this topic.
